__What is it?__

How will you be able to format it? well..as I am not all that advanced(not as good of a Python developer as most) I am making a
hard-coded way to format the code and make it runable.

__What and how I plan on hard-coding a python script to format AND run the .s file__

> As hard of a question that is, the answer is harder. What I plan on happening is actually creating some backend python sections
that define certain variables/items that should be within the file. Then I plan on making another file that builds what a function
and class should look like. Yeah yeah you should get it by now..I am going to hard code how to assign variables, functions, basically just how to write the file.

> But how do I make it to where the GitHub user can compile it? Well that is going to be another python file(of course) that includes the other files on how to build/code the language. And write some basic Python syntax code that checks if certain data(lines of code) is in the file, then re-format it to shell script so you don't have to waste your time writing Shell Script and can write lazily with the .s file!
